# Iris-Data-Classification-

Project Overview:
This project uses machine learning classification algorithms to identify flower species from the classic Iris dataset based on petal and sepal measurements. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models are used, and their performance is compared using accuracy and confusion matrix visualizations.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor), each with four features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Requirements
Python (>=3.6)

pandas

scikit-learn

seaborn

matplotlib

Install dependencies with:

text:
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
Project Structure
iris_classifier.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook with all code, plots, and reports)

How to Run:
Open iris_classifier.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run cells sequentially to:

Load and preprocess the data

Split into training/testing datasets

Train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers

Evaluate models (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

Visualize data with seaborn pairplot

Outputs:
Accuracy and Classification Report for both models

Confusion Matrix heatmaps for visual comparison of model performance

Pairplot to visualize data distributions and classification boundaries

Key Concepts:
Classification in Machine Learning

Decision Trees and Logistic Regression

Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall

Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Train/Test Split for evaluating model performance
